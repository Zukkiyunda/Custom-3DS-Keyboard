# Custom-3DS-Keyboard

Just a little something from me.

Credita to Cooolgamer for being the base of this keyboard with all of his Symbols. Things I have changed is the addition of a couple additional Japanese characters and changing a couple of tab names. His keyboard can be located here: https://github.com/cooolgamer/3DS-custom-keyboard
